# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
`\b` gives you the boundary of words which makes it simpler to find words than using `\s`

# Teacher Feedback

This is true!

`\b` will help with finding specific characters and words at the bound of the string, so looking for a word at the beginning or end of the word. So \b would find a word even if after the word there is a comma or exclamation not just empty space!
